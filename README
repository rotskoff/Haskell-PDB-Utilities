These modules provide an algebraic data type for atoms and proteins.
The data is expected to come from Protein Data Bank .pdb files. 
The parser will interpret ATOM and HETATM record types.

When implementing the parser over a large number of files:

1. Compile your code. 
2. Use mapM_ in your main loop to ensure computations are done sequentially.


At the moment, all vector operations are conducted by Vectors.hs. Be warned that
this is an unsafe module (it makes no effort to check vector lengths, etc.; in our case everything is three dimensional.
